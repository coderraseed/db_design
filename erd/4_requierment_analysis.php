Requirement analysis in RDBMS refers to the process of gathering and analyzing the requirements of the database system to be developed. It is an important phase of the database development life cycle that helps to identify the needs and expectations of the stakeholders, and to define the scope and objectives of the project.

Requirement analysis involves several steps, including:

Gathering requirements: This involves gathering information about the system to be developed, including the user requirements, business requirements, functional requirements, and technical requirements.

Defining scope: This involves defining the scope of the project, including the boundaries of the system, the features and functionality to be included, and the goals and objectives of the project.

Analyzing requirements: This involves analyzing the gathered requirements to identify any inconsistencies or conflicts, and to ensure that the requirements are clear, complete, and unambiguous.

Prioritizing requirements: This involves prioritizing the requirements based on their importance and feasibility, and determining which requirements should be implemented first.

Creating a requirements specification: This involves documenting the requirements in a formal requirements specification, which serves as a blueprint for the design and development of the database system.

Requirement analysis is a critical phase of the database development process, as it lays the foundation for the design and development of the database system. It helps to ensure that the database system meets the needs of the stakeholders, and that the system is designed and developed in a way that is efficient, effective, and scalable.
