Top-down approach in RDBMS is a database design methodology where the database design process starts with identifying the overall organizational goals and objectives. This approach is also known as the "conceptual design" stage, as it focuses on the big picture of the database design, rather than specific details.

The top-down approach involves several steps, including:

Identifying the purpose and goals of the database: This involves understanding the needs and requirements of the organization and the purpose of the database, such as improving efficiency or supporting decision-making.

Defining high-level entities and relationships: This involves identifying the main entities that will be stored in the database, and how they relate to each other. This step helps to create a conceptual data model of the database.

Refining the conceptual data model: This involves refining the conceptual data model by adding more detail and identifying additional entities, attributes, and relationships.

Creating a logical data model: This involves converting the conceptual data model into a logical data model that can be implemented in the database management system. The logical data model includes tables, columns, and relationships between tables.

Implementing the database: This involves creating the physical database by implementing the logical data model in the database management system.

The top-down approach to database design is useful when the organization's goals and objectives are well-defined, and when there is a need for a high-level overview of the database design before diving into specific details. This approach helps to ensure that the database design aligns with the overall goals of the organization, and that the database is structured in a way that supports those goals.
